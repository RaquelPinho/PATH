# $PATH is a enviromental variable
#if you set up a software in the $PATH you can open it in all the directories
#to see the PATH you use:
echo $PATH
#to set up a PATH including a specific directory or software 
PATH=$PATH:/Path/to/directory
#when you load a softare that is already in the $PATH in a slurm server you can see the path after you load software and it will show you the path to the software.
